# Intersection Delay Calculation
Data cleaning, processing, calculations with Pandas
## Overview
The objective is to calculate delay distributions at signal-controlled intersections from sensor data.
I developed an algorithm for estimating delay distributions from stop bar detector and advance detector data for different hours of the day. Queued vehicles were taken into account.

## Data Source
The data is confidential and thus is not included. The outputs of the notebooks are not displayed for the same reason.
