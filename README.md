# Intersection Delay Calculation
Data cleaning, processing, calculations with Pandas
## Overview
The objective is to calculate delay distributions at signal-controlled intersections from sensor data.
I translated stop bar detector and advance detector data into delay distributions for different hours of the day. Queued vehicles were taken into account.

## Data Source
Data is not included due to the confidentiality of the data. The outputs of the Notebook are not displayed for the same reason.
